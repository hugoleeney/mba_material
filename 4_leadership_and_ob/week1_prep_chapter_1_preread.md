Human capital - the knowledge skills, abilities, cretivity and other resources that employees bring to the organisation. The most important ingredient in the organisation's process of transforming inputs to outputs.

corporate responsibility as a means of increasing organisations effectiveness
triple bottome line philosophy - organisations must serve other people other than shareholders and customers

firms with better csr reputation have better results ... {C/E bias}

# The systematic research anchor

study organisiations using systematic research methods

# practical orientation anchor

ensure that ob theories are useful in organisations

# multidisciplinary anchor

import knowledge from other disciplines, not just create its own knowledge

# contigency anchor

recognize that the effectiveness of an action may depend on the situation

# multiple levels of analysis anchor

understand OB events from 3 levels of analysis - individual, team, org

# diversity

* surface level
* deep-level diversity
    * can't be seen
        * some surface levels are clues
            * men women have different
                * conflict handling preferences
                * ethical principles
                * approaches to communicating

* informational diversity
    * contributes to creativity and better decision making 
* cultural
    * may be more able to recognise needs
    * contingent on leadership, team structure, psychological saftey perceptions, personal values

diversity can cause teams to take longer to perform effectively together

research: diversity is good up to a point

work-life integration {work-life balance is not good enough phrase :D}

integration - dogs and kids at work may be more viable than we think

right to disconnect {thats definitely work-life balance}

eco benfits of remote work

personal/social disadvantages of remote work

remote when task performance is measurable

TREND - non-direct employment
* part time
* on call
* casual
* seasonal
* contract
* platform workers (perhaps closer to on call - abiding by T&Cs and dependent on the platform)
