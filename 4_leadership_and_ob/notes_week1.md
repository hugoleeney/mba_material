# HR vs OB

HR is the system
OB is what people do in the system
    - explaining why people behave the way they do at work

individual -> group -> organisation

OB is an applied social science involving study of people, groups, decision making, power, politics, ethics, culture

There may ultimately be no long-term sustainable advantage except the ability to organise and manage.
