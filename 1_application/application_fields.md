# Essay Questions
	 
## Beyond what is outlined in your Curriculum Vitae, what will be your unique contribution to your MBA class? (Max. 300 words). DO NOT exceed the word count available. 	

I have strong technical skills. I take pride in the ability to analyse problems and use my skills to make quick informed decisions under pressure. However, what I believe makes me more unique is that through other areas of experience - including sports, the arts and my involvement in my family's childcare business - I recognize the importance of non-technical value, listening and human connection. I intend to contribute by being endlessly curious about the interaction between these tectonic plates.

## What in your opinion is UCD Smurfit Schools' responsibility to you as an MBA student and what is your responsibility to the School? (Max. 300 words). DO NOT exceed the word count available. 	

The school's responsibility to me is to provide cutting edge information and data, a variety of learning opportunities with varying risk levels and a real intention to continuously adapt this to the latest best practice and the particular student cohort. It is also of great value to present as an ongoing resource throughout an alumnus' career and life.

My responsibility as a student is firstly step into those learning opportunities fearlessly, to have the intention to leverage the lessons and experiences to further my career (only by doing that will I and the school benefit and grow) and to give generously to my (and where possible other) student cohorts.

## What are your career expectations in the 3 years post MBA? (Max. 300 words). DO NOT exceed the word count available. 	

I have had the goal ever since working in NovaUCD during my PhD of being a leader in Technology. In the last few years my career took a path towards self-employment and entrepreneurship. More recently it has settled into a position where I will be working full-time but have an option to continue with entrepreneurial projects. With the knowledge, skills and network I acquire during the MBA program I hope that I can grow one or several of these projects into a viable business over the next 5 years.

## Upon reflection have your career goals, opinion of UCD Smurfit and aspirations to pursue an MBA, changed since your last application? (Max. 300 words). To be completed by re-applicants only. 	

# Motivation for Pursuing an MBA
	 
## Please copy and paste the statement that resonates most 	

A UCD Smurfit MBA will improve my leadership skills to have greater impact at work

## Why do you most identify with your chosen statement?
(Max. 300 words). DO NOT exceed the word count available. 	

Although my career expectations are to work towards entrepreneurial goals, I have a broader horizon in terms of the expectations I have of the MBA experience. Whether my career follows a path towards entrepreneurship or perhaps a role in technology leadership within a company I want the MBA experience to enable success in all paths and I think Smurfit is the best place to have it thanks to its strong industry connections, excellent innovation track record and membership of GNAM. I chose this statement because leadership skills are a key component of the equation for me and in the abstract 'having greater impact' is my end goal.
