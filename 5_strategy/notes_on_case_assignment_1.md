10% class window

by 1975only 740 or higher
no new models

35% dealer markup
27% or prod cost on distribution

design - honda did mkt-res and cost analy. 0.75 per mill, 17k wage, personnell = 1/2
       - 2.7 per mill, no cost analy, no PM, 18months + 18 months

nvt req'd 48mill to uptool 
- would reduce total cost per unit if similar components exceeded 50,000 (Honda had families with similar componenets)
- provide for 100k cycles

production experience had produced cost reductions of 20%

Honda had custom tooling. 

NVT - 3 factories, no experience curve

Honda 16k employees at 4 factories most assembly earn 8.5k, 1.5 more mc per worker of high cc 
NVT minority in assembly most in machine tools, earn 5.8k

morale  in Meriden

Honda worked to coloc suppliers and shared r&D
NVT suppliers equally backward

Honda advert 10M, NVT 0.8M. Honda selling 30 times more

Honda allowed lower markup than NVT

NVT 1/30 o honda market, in 1/5th of honda dealerships 1/12 or excl dealers

Q is NVT revenue falling or just bike numbers?
Q - can they reach numbers of parts

Conclusions
============
buyers traded up ... but market was not growing 
NVT has same number of models as other manu, fraction of market share
get exclusive dealers
get more dealers
better suppliers of parts
NVT should increase their margin


Strategic alternatives
=======================
marketting
- tattoos
- film
- fix it market


# AIMS

NVT should aim to become profitable again and return sales to levels of 1972
- path 1: aim to get sales to 50k and to retool 
    - note: that this will only help if volume is high enough - they certainly don't have that now
- path 2: don't retool aim to economize and diversify sales

Question) why do NVT want to reduce number of dealers? Is it because many are non-performant? Seems like number of dealers (particularly exclusive dealers) matters.

# Comments 
- not a lot of options open, prices already increased - potential cause of recent bad sales
- no historical view of profits :/


# measures

id  (path)  action
1. (1 & 2) revamp marketting BECAUSE NVT ineffective Honda are spending much less per sale
	- lean in to the fix it yourself
	- market parts and tools direct to consume
    - tattoos & films
2. (1 & 2) acquire more exclusive dealers BECAUSE exhibit 8 shows correlation
	- reintroduce consignment? what other incentive do they have?
3. (1 & 2) continue to focus on large cc (but see 5.)
4. (1 & 2) shut down a factory and/or colocate suppliers there or in proportional sized areas of all premises. reconsider suppliers for more tech advanced one and synergise
5. (1 & 2) riders traded up - brand loyalty - need a smaller bike for beginners? loss leader? 
6. (1*) reform design deparment, do cost analysis of features, do Project Management
7. (1) reduce base models - they have nearly as many as Honda
	- but increase variants?


how do you 
- get more exclusive dealers
- give dealers less money - increase your margins
- give them less hassle
-
