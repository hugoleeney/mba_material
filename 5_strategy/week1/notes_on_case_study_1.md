failure to achieve a cost position - cost reductions over time - equivalent to our competitors will result in commercial vulnerability
at some point your competitors will start setting prices which you cannot match profitably and losses will ensue. 

the importance of the experience curve is that it explains clearly the 2 possible long term cause of uncompetitive costs
- relative growth  - failure to grow as rapidly as competitor - thereby progressin more slowly than them along experience curve
- relative slopes - failure to bring costs down the characteristic experience curve slope achieved by competitors

price premiums for US market is real - not just costs
"implication of the downward trends in real prices for the japanese is that there have been underlying experience based cost reductions: that the decline has not been accounted for simply by a reduction in margins... japanese manufacturers have been continuously profitable and this suggest tht cost reductions have indeed taken place. 
- question about whether bike busienss was subisdised by other lines
    - "seems clear" that thats not the case
