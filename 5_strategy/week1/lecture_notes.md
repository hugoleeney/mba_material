how do we compete
what is it that compels customer to buy our products over others
- the theory  is that their STRATEGY did that (hl: lol)
- imply cause and effect



# distinction against corporate strategy 

which is *where* we compete - industries and geographies, like at the level of a group of businesses

virigin group doesn't compete - its a sttructure
- within whch you have other businesses
- its the business that compete

e.g. acquire a competitor
- won't ever improve problems that you have with customers
- might help financially
- (hl: well e.g. if disney bought netflix ... Atlassian bought github)


what has Honda done that seem to have driven its success particularly in the US?
- offered different cc bikes
- 


what has honda done that seems to have driven its success particularly in the us
- what is success? more customers choose your product over alternaives
- what did they do

low price + good product = ignite demand 
satisfied - mass production
gave them scale plus experience economies
lowered the cost which goes back to low price
THESE HAVE INTERNAL CONSISTENCY

can't be random disconnected actions

identify a strategy
strategy is what they did that helped - not cause and effect
