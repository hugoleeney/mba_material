lead acid
- can provide large surges
- heavy for the energy stored (unimportant for stationary applications)

valve regulated lead acids
- packaged for better reliability and perf
- gel cell
    - semi solid electrolyte
    - absorbed glass mat - fiberglass to absorb electrolyte and separate lead plates
- good for virbartion and cold

li-ion
- most popular
- lithium cobalt oxide 
- very high energy density with some safety risk


criteria
- energy density
- number of recycles
- self discharge to 50%
- recharge time
- cost


# Back bay
- started as specialist in AGM
- industrial apps for short surges
- x3 expensive than flooded lead acid, cheaper than li-ion
- x2 lifetime that lead acid
- no discharge fumes on overcharging
    - on boats and military equipment
- business as supplier to integrators of UPSs
- power management apps requiring many rapid charge/discharge

## applications
- automobiles
    - interior coz sealed
    - start stop - increased power demands and frequent cycling
    - regen braking
- warehouse equipment   
    - high startup power
    - frequent charging cycles
- UPSs  - backup power for datacenters
    - 15 secs

confident in these markets 
but large competitive investents in tech for electric vehicles

## 2-3% of revenue on R&D
- self-discharge
- increasing energy density
    - harder to do - more costly
- process improvement and increased yield
- BBB has been spending to reduce self discharge
    - x3-10 better than gel
    - x50-50 better than flooded cell

# Capacitors

## better because
- charge more quickly
- no problem of memory or limitations on number of charging cycles
- much more energy at a lower voltage
- able to delvier huge surges

## Capacitors BAD
- high self-discharge
    - 40-50% in a month
- challenge is physical size- energy density
    - 10 watt hours/kg

good for bursts of power
possible hybrid approach of capacitor and AGM

## applications

emergency lighting
backup power
portable power tools


# R&D 

projects cost rnage of 1-7 for 4-7 years
3 major fronts - difficult to assess what competitors are setting as spend priority
