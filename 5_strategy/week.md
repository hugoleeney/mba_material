# does spotify have a competitive advantage?

competitors - why would we sign up for spotify
- apple
- deezer
- spotify
    - full catalogue
    - sign up for free
    - social (network effect)
    - (no) market leaders
    - early mover
    - better recomendations (indirect network effect)
    - ease of use
    - quality of sound

what is the ease that it can be copied


network effect
- can come from network effect
- value to any one user increaseas the more user that are on the platform


is network effect about business adv sometimes

is competitive advantage only about why we would sign up for spotify?
- other things would probably lead to price

when you get more users - when do you stop? how much do you spend?
