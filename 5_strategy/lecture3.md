- nestle has an existing presence in china - up and running quickly
- N has huge advantage budget
- sourcing globally - no supply problems?
- signal of nestles intent
- lead to further increased comp
- has huge resources
- no scientific foundation

## no

- nestle will bring attention to a2 milk
- a2mc are well established - auz and nz milk
- legitimizes A2
- will conflict with N A1 position
- A2MC has complex IP position difficult to replicate
- a2mc does not have a strong position in china daigou

## Nestle whats their intent?

- control the narrative
- another potential brand
- conflict with A1?

    - what is the source of the adv
        - the brand
        - unique product
        - control of the supply pool / partnership with fonterra
            - patents contracts (cooperative)
        - no a1 baggage (absence of disadvantage)
        - ownership of IP
            - system

5- 10 years for herd conversion
up to 2036 for some patents

# what should a2mc do?
