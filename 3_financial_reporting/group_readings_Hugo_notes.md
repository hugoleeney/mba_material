# Reading Presentation - The six legged stool

- what may be interesting about my approach?
    - rearrange the content a bit to 
        - motivate the presentation better
        - provide the historical context up front
        - talk about governing bodies first so that they can be more clearly referenced
        - add the government itself as an omitted entity - he talks about Sarbane Oxley so much yet it is not identified as a indiv. contributor.

Entertainment
- build a six legged stool
    - break one leg off each time we address a point
    - if the legs were edible or full of sweets that would be fun
- have a slide of a poo emoji with six human or insect legs

# Niamh Brennan - Accounting in Crisis

Where 'the six legged stool' lays out why each leg contributes to quality FR 'Accounting in Crisis' identifies the defects in each leg and suggests that sitting on the stool may not be something you should do without due caution. One paper attaches the legs, the other rips them off.

The entities indentified and their supposed stated purpose is much the same in each paper. Niamh Brennan takes a more analytical approach.

- Introduction
    * motivated by scandal
    * equating CG with balance of power between all SH - when it is uneven problems arise
- FR in the context of CG
    * in effect shareholders entrust the running of the company to the management.
        * management have conflicts of interest 
        * FR are there to bridge the gap
        * auditors are there as referees
            * brennan again notes that the public overestimates the responsibilities of the auditors
    - respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
    - objective of audits
    - materiality
- inherent limitations of accounting
        - how to value assets
    - accounting is a work of art
        - when are they recorded
    - the human element and the temptation to manage earnings
    - exploiting ambiguities in the rules
- key safeguards
    - audit committees
    - internal audit
    - external audit
        - non-audit services
        - lengthy relationship with auditors
        - prior and personal relationships between auditors and clients
        - relative size of fees from clients
        - self regulation
- other safe guards
    - role of analysts
- summary and conclusions


# external auditors
- audits are limited - not all encompassing
- FR represent one way of balancing the numbers - an interpretation
    - audits don't gaurantee their accuracy only reasonable assurance
    - indicate absence of material mis-statement - not a commentary on the interpretation
- incentivised to choose high levels of materialtiy - which is undisclosed
- who choose them
- incentives to chagne auditors?, lengthy relationships, non-audit services
- connections between audit firms and employees
- dependency on fees
- self-regulation of audit firms - review each others work?


# audit committees

- who choose and on what basis
- weak mamangement not intereseted in strong directors
- management can omit or hide information from committees

# internal audit
-  best practive that internal audit has direct access to audit committee
    - but CEO still pays the wages and promotes
- not objective and free of conflict of interest


# analyst firms
- firing of Tery smith
- mismatched time frame of clients (pensioners)

# top management

- obviously self-interested
- can influence internal audit
- can resist BoD and audit committee
- can withhold information
- how to put a money value on something
- subjective view of director
- when to record soemthing is most common fraud
- temptation to massage because - to make investors happy
- market expectations
- smooth out rough ride

# governing body 
- varies from place to place
- best practice not regulation sometimes
- inter reliance on audit, internal audit
- circumventing of rules
    - e.g. non-audit services restrictions
    - SEC chariman ARthur Levitt called it 'culture of gamesmanship'
- exploiting ambiguities
    - UK has less than US in GAAP

# BoD

- the gap between board of directors and management can leave them toothless
- how do they get elected - top execs often involved
- removal of troublesome directors
-
