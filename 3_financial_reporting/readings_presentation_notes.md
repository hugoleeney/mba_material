In 'Accounting in Crisis' the auther assumes the same structure and purpose of CG as the preivous paper. Brennan however takes a more analytic approach and explains the flaws in CG and FR and poitns to their sources.

The the highest level the source of fragility is human weakness and the lack of effective safeguards for its effect.
- the paper sets out or infers many conflicts of interest in the various actors and stakeholders within audit, CG and Mng. All these actors make decisions and all have self-interests and relationships with other people within the structure. Under the current conditions compromise the systems of transparency and accountability is inevitiable.

===========================================================================

The paper sets out that FRs are only one perspective of the financial position of the company.
External auditors only report on whether in their opinion the FRs provide one true and fair view. They only provide reasonable assurance that finanicial statements are free from mis-statement.

mANY points of subjectivity are listed in the paper - one taht might seem inoccuous to the uniniatiated would be when a transaction is recorded in the reports
- however many investors in one company Worldcom that once listed over 100 billion in assets  fell victim to misreporting in this way

Specific points of subjectivitiy in the reports include
- what constitutes materiality
- the nature and value of assets # - whether certain real or abstract things constitute an asset
- when a transaction is recorded - Worldcom is cited as an example of when bad judgements in this domain had catastrophic results
- where there are rules people set out to game them

the author specifically address three entities and how they are vulnerable
audit committee
- The board and the committee are chosen and dispoosed in a way that is vulnerable to manipulation, bias and self-interest
- the realtionship between between the board, the committe and top-management is also a source of pressure to act in certain ways

the second entity is internal audit
- who are hired directly by management, which can override any training in best practice or moral compulsion

the third entity is external audit
- just one example of how management's and the audit firm's judgement can be impaired is when the audit firm offers other non-audit services. the high monetary value of such services can bias the audit firm to be influenced by managements interests.

the auther also mentions Analyst firms
- as actual or potential service provider to the firm in question the analyst company is not interested in truly objective analysis

The paper does highlight some reports that were recent at the time of writing that recommended specific action to enhance the effectiveness of CG
These were the higgs report and the smith report.
at a high level these reports recommended actions to remove subjectivity, bias and self-interest from FR, CG and audit by constraining, systemizing and formalizing aspects of both director and auditor selection, training and evaluation.


=================================================================================================
the paper sets out that FRs are only one perspective on the FP of a company
external auditors only report on whether in their opinion the FRs provide
- one true and fair view
they only aim to provide reasonable assurance that the reporst are free from misstatement

human weakness is central to many of the issues highlighted. where there is subjectivity and judgemnet in decision making individuals are susceptible to internal biases and acting in self-interest rather than in the interest of investors and other stakeholders
- one point of subjectivity that may seem inoccuous to the uninitiated is the decision when to record a transaction in the reports - however, many investors in Worldcom fell victim to misreporting of this type - a company that once listed over 100 biullion dollars in assets and shortly after ceased to exist

3 entities from the preivous paper are explicitly called out
audit committee - how they are chosen is vulnerable to and subsequently their relationships with board and Mng is a source of pressure to act in certain ways
internal audit - hired by management - perceived authority and personal debt overrides training in BP or moral compulsion
external audit - just one example of how audits firm judgement can be impaired is when that firm offers other non-audit services and the high monetary value of such services can bias the audit firm to be influenced by managemnets interests
- how they are chosen, hired, and evaluated constitutes a pressure on those individuals to act in ways that undermine the quality and integrity of FR

not mentioned in our previous paper - analyst firms
as actual or potential service providers to the company the analysts aren't interested in truly objective analysis

the paper sets out stating that FRs are only 
- one of many possible perspectives on the FP of a company
external auditors only report on whether in their opinion the FRs provide
- one true and fair view
- and at best they only aim to provide reasonable assurance that the reporst are free from misstatement

as the paper goes into more detail 
- human weakness is central to many of the issues highlighted. 
- * Where there is subjectivity and judgemnet in decision making 
-   individuals are susceptible to internal biases and act in self-interest rather than in the interest of investors and other stakeholders
one point of subjectivity that may seem inoccuous to the uninitiated 
- is the decision when to record a transaction in the reports 
- * many investors in Worldcom fell victim to misreporting of this type 
-  a company that once listed over 100 biullion dollars in assets and shortly after ceased to exist

3 entities from the previous paper are explicitly called out
- audit committee (and by inference the board), internal audit, external audit
- * How they are 
    chosen, 
    remunerated, and 
    evaluated constitutes a pressure on those individuals to act in ways that undermine the quality and integrity of FR
- It is through relationships with management that these often come to bear

not mentioned in our previous paper - analyst firms
- as actual or potential service providers to the company 
- the analysts aren't interested in truly objective analysis and 
- cease to represent a source of truth

The paper does highlight some reports that were recent at the time of writing that recommended specific action to enhance the effectiveness of CG
- These were the higgs report and the smith report.
- at a high level these reports recommended actions to remove 
    - subjectivity, 
    - bias and 
    - self-interest 
.. from FR, CG and audit 
in large part the reccomendations are to 
    - constrain
    - systemize and 
    - further formalize
aspects of the 
    - selection
    - training and 
    - evaluation.
