how have dtc brands become successful
1. customer insight:
    - personal experience
        - setup pre-launch website
        - we look at exception rather than the rule - survivorship bias
    - consumer listneing/social listening
        - glossier
    - search and purchase data
        -look for dissatisfaction - Aterian
    CONS:
        - bias from experience
        - is there a mass market? you are getting extreme information
            - early adopters
2. research and development
    - they don't really invest - simple products
        (investment must be linked to a benefit)
    - product lines - limited
3. production
    - outsourced
4. marketting communications and distribution
    - in history the only brands able to advertise (cost) were big brands and segments were coarse

5. customer experience
    - personalized, responsive, lots of review, community, identity
    - product as way for you to link with others
