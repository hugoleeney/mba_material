# Health Service Report

1. Structure

- Overall very standard
- no total summing up at the end although summary at start is precise
- executive summary is comprehensive - possibly a shorter form would be possible

2. formatting

- very standard

3. writing style

- effective and relatively simple
- is some jargon but there is a glossary
- effective use of bullet points

4. tables/figures etc

- appropriate sizes
- tables and figures clearly laid out and labelled
- consistent use of reccomendations boxes

5. Content

specific and actionably


# McKinsey Worlds School Systems Report

1. Structure

exec summary/contents/forewaord/preface/introduction/1/2/3/conclusiong/bib/ref

- exec summary is short and to the point
- contents is too short
- not enough sub-headings
- no appendices for more info
- no tables index ..
- structure stands up in terms of purpose, content perhaps does not

2. formatting

- text too dense
- choice of fonts is questionable
- lots of dead space and blank pages

3. writing style

- some effective use of bullets and lists but could be more
- language is ok but quite corporate-speak

4. tables/figures

- could be larger
- could be more of them

5. Content

not specific, not very actionable


# RBS

1. structure

- title
- about
- contents
- key corporate responsibility highlights
- grop chiefs exec statemetn
- how the group manages CR
- stakeholder engagement
- issues that matter most
    - financial crime
    - customer service
    - selling and lending practices
    - employee practices
    - environmental impact
    - community investment
    - global lending and project finance
    - financial education
    - financial inclusion
    - small business support
- our progress and priorities
- gri content index
- independent assurance statement
- contact us

- no tables index ..
- progression makes sense 
- sub-section headings not in TOC


2. writing style

some elements of corporate speak. listing of actions taken are quite clear but it comes off as marketting content because there is no analysis

3. formatting

- very dense text
- lots of dead space
- unnecessary images

4. tables/figures

- key corporate responsibility highlights is useless page
- some effective use of breakout boxes but could integrate them into a regular format style
- not surprise there is not more tables and figures given content

5. content

- owing to the fact that this is an internal report the content is not very actionable. Reads more like marketing. no clear problem statement or conclusion. just a list of stuff
- each section is fairly well bookended though with motivation and next year priorities
