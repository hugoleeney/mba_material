All vigorous writing is characterized by being concise. All sentences should only contain necessary words and all paragraphs should contain only necessary sentences such that the authors meaning and narrative line is conserved. Writing can be compared to an artists drawing, an engineers design or a machine, none of which should contain superfluous lines, parts or components. Adjectives, adverbs and qualifiers are often necessary but as per the above assertions, each should contribute something unique to the message.
