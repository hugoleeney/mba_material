    "we use case studies as a tool to understand and practice theory"


# class structure

must read theory and case study before class
- see examples of theory playing out in the case
    - cost or differentiation based adv etc.
- why would the org choose that basis, go aftter that customer, choose that manuf process etc

# what do you learn?

whats the answer? with strategy its more fluid
many answers to what should they do next
diverse answers are 'allowed'
2 types of learnings
- global (whole class)
- learnings specific to you

strategy
- cost based
- differentiation based

in case studies micro-detail is important

# SUPPLY CHAIN OF N95 MASKS

* handout of University of Virginia's 'A Perfect Storm: Examining the Supply Chain for N95 masks during COVID-19'


## why were we so unprepared

* lots of diff factors
    * national strategic stockpile
    * surge in demand
    * lack of IT infra
    * JIT system at hospitals
    * globalization assumptions - stock in one country 
    * panic buying e.g. China
    * China epicenter - dependence on China
    * complexity of supply 
        * political issues in the US - strategic national stockpile
        * decisions made to stop stockpiling pandemic resources
    * raw materials shortage e.g. elastic bands
    * available in different locations - not visible
    * privatised hospitals - IT systems - not noeed to share data
    * SC not need to be agile
    * demand effect not linear
    * huge levels of uncertainty

## what would you do next

* gov issue guidleine re stockpiling
* reclassify masks as essential stock appropriately
    * does this fix the issue?

# Student question - how will we know what to take home from a case study

* really that is up to you.
* everybody will see different angles, have different contexts and different things will seem more significant
