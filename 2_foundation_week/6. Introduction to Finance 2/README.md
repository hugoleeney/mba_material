1. some brick and online retailer IPO
    * wework similar overpriced - hot desking, what else?
2. FB M&A
    * made a potential acquisition pay a dividend to reduce price of the company below threshold of regulation


# Answers to Homework

## Question

* materiality of unbalanced values - maybe < 0.001 percent 


# Lesson

during account period transactions recorded on a cash received/paid basis

accruals kicks in at the year end - accruals accounting

transactions recognised when they occur not just when money is recv'd paid

match against revenue the related expense

## Year-end adjusting entries (p.18)


### accruals (add the expense)
converts cash accounting to the accruals
is it a debit or credit? its both!
in homework - year end adjustment for closing stock
    * one side is in income statement
    * other is in the balance sheet
    * single year end adjusting entry

revenues and expenses that relate to more than one period
recognize revenue when it is earned

cost of goods sold = opening stock + purchases - closing stock
! match against revenue the expenses incurred in generating that revenue whether paid for or not
! recognise revenue in the period it is earned

accruals of expense items

* expenses normally only recorded in nominal ledger when paid
* expenses incurred but not paid for will nont appear in the NL
* expenses incurred but not piaid for must be accrued

### prepayment (reduce the expense)

* a PP is items paid for which will provide future benefit
* show as current assts in the balance sheet
* reduces the expense to whih it relates in the profit and lossacount
* current asset (benefit in one year) as prepayment

e.g stationay paid for  in a year 80, stationary left worth 20k

20k in current assets/prepayments and other receivables

60k is in PnL

## Depreciation

expense of property plant and equipment
expense of use tangible fixed assets
non-current assets
writing off the cost in one year not in accordance with the matching principle

keep fully depreciated asset on blanace sheet evvven after fully dpreciated (pg 28 book)

## amortisation

intangible assets

## impairment

once off value destruction
e.g. housing bubble burst, industry disruption

brand values usually not in balance sheet - so normally no impairment

GAAP general accepted accounting principle

## methods of depreciation

* straight line depreciation
    * cost - residual value / useful life
* reducing balance method
    * percentage of net boook value


## Fixed assets

not purchases of property plant and equip - we use additions

assets purchased during the year - depreciated depending on the policy


Example 2.7: disposal of a fixed asset pg 37

## bad debts

if asset is non-recoverable then valuing it on statements is fraudulent

bad debt is removed from current assets and recorded as expense on income statement

### provisions for bad depts

bad debtor - move from receivable on balance sheet to expense on income statement
bad debt provision  - charged as expense on IS. negative on asset on balance sheet

if the provision for bad debt can go minus. Like a minus cost instead of a revenue.
